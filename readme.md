lua-widow-control
=================

Lua-widow-control is a Plain TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt package that removes most widows and orphans from a document, _without_ stretching any glue or shortening any pages. It does so by automatically lengthening a paragraph on a page where a widow or orphan would otherwise occur. 

Please see the [full documentation](docs/lwc-documentation.pdf) for more.
