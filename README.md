lua-widow-control
=================

Lua-widow-control is a Plain TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt package that removes widows and orphans without any user intervention. Using the power of LuaTeX, it does so _without_ stretching any glue or shortening any pages. Instead, lua-widow-control automatically lengthens a paragraph on a page where a widow or orphan would otherwise occur. 

Please see the [full documentation](https://github.com/gucci-on-fleek/lua-widow-control/releases/latest/download/lua-widow-control.pdf) for more.
